# tic :zap:

A small [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) âš¡ module, primarily meant for my own experiments with [TIC-80](https://tic80.com/) ðŸŽ®

Based on the [tic80.zig template](https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80/blob/main/templates/zig/src/tic80.zig), with a few small fixes here and there. :bug:

## Usage

You can have `zig build` retrieve the `tic` module if you specify it as a dependency.

### Create a `build.zig.zon` that looks something like this:
```zig
.{
    .name = "tic80-zig-game",
    .version = "0.0.1",
    .paths = .{""},
    .dependencies = .{
        .tic = .{
            .url = "https://github.com/peterhellberg/tic/archive/561f1781861a87ed3e97d5a454632702faeb052a.tar.gz",
            .hash = "1220cd872564f9f56d46bb7477195be8f5b90549c3ce13faf32d5651097dee2d736f",
        },
    },
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you leave out the hash then `zig build` will tell you that it is missing the hash, and what it is.

### Then you can add the module in your `build.zig` like this:
```zig
// Add the tic module to the executable
exe.addModule("tic", b.dependency("tic", .{}).module("tic"));
```

In your `src/main.zig` you should now be able to:
```zig
const tic = @import("tic");
const std = @import("std");

export fn BDR(row: i32) void {
    const v = tic.time() / 99 + @as(f32, @floatFromInt(row)) / 2;
    tic.poke(0x3ff9, @intFromFloat(2 + std.math.sin(v) * 1.2));
}

export fn TIC() void {
    tic.rect(0, 13, 92, 57, 4);
    tic.rect(107, 13, 50, 11, 12);
    tic.rect(107, 60, 49, 11, 12);
    tic.rect(164, 14, 12, 56, 12);
    tic.elli(214, 42, 32, 30, 12);
    tic.elli(214, 42, 18, 18, 0);
    tic.tri(223, 40, 240, 19, 240, 40, 0);
    tic.tri(209, 40, 236, 40, 236, 56, 12);
    tic.rect(236, 40, 4, 25, 0);
    tic.rect(226, 48, 4, 9, 12);
    tic.tri(141, 22, 107, 61, 124, 60, 12);
    tic.tri(124, 60, 139, 22, 157, 24, 12);
    tic.tri(18, 27, 28, 13, 22, 28, 0);
    tic.tri(28, 13, 22, 28, 33, 13, 0);
    tic.tri(19, 57, 8, 70, 13, 70, 0);
    tic.tri(19, 57, 13, 70, 24, 57, 0);
    tic.rect(15, 27, 66, 31, 0);
    tic.tri(3, 83, 49, 26, 43, 56, 4);
    tic.tri(43, 56, 51, 16, 87, 0, 4);
    tic.tri(73, 27, 84, 13, 77, 13, 0);
    tic.tri(77, 13, 64, 31, 73, 27, 0);
    tic.tri(76, 57, 64, 72, 70, 57, 0);
    tic.tri(70, 57, 65, 70, 60, 70, 0);
    if (tic.btn(4)) tic.exit();
}
```

## Example `build.zig`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure that you `exe.export_symbol_names` the [TIC-80 Callbacks](https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80/wiki/API#callbacks) you are using.

```zig
const std = @import("std");

pub fn build(b: *std.Build) !void {
    const exe = b.addExecutable(.{
        .name = "cart",
        .root_source_file = .{ .path = "src/main.zig" },
        .target = .{ .cpu_arch = .wasm32, .os_tag = .wasi },
        .optimize = .ReleaseSmall,
    });

    // Add the tic module to the executable
    exe.addModule("tic", b.dependency("tic", .{}).module("tic"));

    // Add the zlm (Zig Linear Mathemathics) module to the executable
    exe.addModule("zlm", b.dependency("zlm", .{}).module("zlm"));

    // No entry point in the WASM
    exe.entry = .disabled;

    // All the memory below 96kb is reserved for TIC
    // and memory mapped I/O so our own usage must
    // start above the 96kb mark
    exe.global_base = 96 * 1024;
    exe.stack_size = 8192;

    // Four WASM memory pages
    const memory: u64 = 65536 * 4;
    exe.initial_memory = memory;
    exe.max_memory = memory;
    exe.import_memory = true;

    // Export symbols for use by TIC
    exe.export_symbol_names = &[_][]const u8{
        "TIC",
        "BDR",
        "BOOT",
    };

    // Move the cart to the root of the repo
    const move_cart = b.addSystemCommand(&[_][]const u8{
        "mv",
        "zig-out/bin/cart.wasm",
        "cart.wasm",
    });

    move_cart.step.dependOn(b.getInstallStep());

    b.default_step = &move_cart.step;

    b.installArtifact(exe);
}
```

## Example `cart.wasmp`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can only use the `wasmp` format if you run the [TIC-80 Pro Version](https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80#pro-version)

```lua
-- desc:   TIC-80 Zig Example
-- script: wasm
"
Code is compiled from src/main.zig
into zig-out/bin/cart.wasm

Load it like this:

import binary zig-out/bin/cart.wasm
run
